No jargon overload, promise!</p>

                <h3>1. Prescription Drug Caps Get an Inflation Tune-Up – Wallet Wins!</h3>
                <p>Remember the 2025 $2,000 out-of-pocket cap on Part D drugs?

                <p>Part B premium? Up to about $185/month (from $174.70 in 2025), with deductibles at $240. Part A hospital deductible?
